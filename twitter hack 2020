A notable example is the 2020 Twitter hack, where attackers used social engineering to gain access to internal systems. They compromised high-profile accounts, including those of Elon Musk and Barack Obama, and posted fraudulent messages promising to double users’ Bitcoin investments. This scam led to losses exceeding $100,000 before Twitter intervened.

The incident had widespread repercussions. It undermined public trust in Twitter, particularly in its account verification system, and highlighted the dangers of misinformation. Had the attackers spread false political news, the consequences could have been far more severe. This event underscored the urgent need for stronger cybersecurity measures and greater awareness of online threats—not only in the corporate world but also in everyday life.
A similar cyberattack occurred in 2013 when the Associated Press (AP) Twitter account was hacked. The attackers used the compromised account to post a false tweet claiming that explosions at the White House had injured then-President Barack Obama. Though the tweet was quickly debunked, the damage was immediate: the U.S. stock market briefly plunged, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropping around 150 points in just minutes, erasing nearly $140 billion in market value.

This incident showcased the enormous influence that trusted social media accounts can have, especially when spreading misinformation. The hackers exploited the credibility of a well-known news source to manipulate public perception and financial markets. Although the motive appeared to be disruption rather than direct financial gain, such attacks demonstrate how misinformation, even if short-lived, can lead to significant economic and societal consequences.
